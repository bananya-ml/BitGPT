1. INTRODUCTION

The Spitzer Space Telescope Legacy Surveys SAGE (Meixner
et al. 2006) and SAGE-SMC (K. D. Gordon et al. 2010, in
preparation) have made a comparative study of the infrared
properties of massive stars at a range of metallicities possible
for the ﬁrst time by imaging the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds (LMC and SMC). In Bonanos et al. (2009, hereafter
Paper I), we presented infrared properties of massive stars in the
LMC (at 0.5 Z(cid:3)). The motivation for that study was twofold:
(1) to use the infrared excesses of massive stars to probe their
winds, circumstellar gas, and dust, and (2) to provide a template
for studies of other, more distant, galaxies. Paper I was the ﬁrst
major compilation of accurate spectral types and multi-band
photometry from 0.3 to 24 μm for massive stars in any galaxy,
increasing by an order of magnitude the number of massive

stars for which mid-infrared photometry was available. The
recently completed SAGE-SMC survey offers the opportunity
to extend the study of infrared properties of massive stars to a
metallicity of approximately 0.2 Z(cid:3)(see, e.g., Hunter et al. 2007)
and enables the investigation of their dependence on metallicity,
at least over the range 0.2–0.5 Z(cid:3).

Infrared excess in hot massive stars is primarily due to
free–free emission from their ionized, line-driven, stellar winds.
Panagia & Felli (1975) and Wright & Barlow (1975) ﬁrst
computed the free–free emission from ionized envelopes of
hot massive stars, as a function of the mass-loss rate ( ˙M)
and the terminal velocity of the wind (v∞). The properties
of massive stars, and in particular their stellar winds (which
affect their evolution), are expected to depend on metallicity
(Z). For example, Mokiem et al. (2007) found empirically that
˙M ∼ Z0.83±0.16, in good agreement
mass-loss rates scale as

with theoretical predictions (Vink et al. 2001). The expectation,
therefore, is that the infrared excesses of OB stars in the SMC
˙M is lower in the
should be lower than in the LMC, given that
SMC.14 Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the fraction
of classical Be stars among B-type stars is higher at lower
metallicity (possibly due to faster rotation, as measured by
Martayan et al. 2007b). Grebel et al. (1992) were the ﬁrst to
ﬁnd evidence for this, by showing that the cluster NGC 330 in
the SMC has the largest fraction of Be stars of any known cluster
in the Galaxy, LMC or SMC. More recent spectroscopic surveys
(Martayan et al. 2010) have reinforced this result. In Paper I, we
showed that the Be stars in the LMC are easily discriminated
by their mid-infrared colors; we are therefore interested in a
comparison with the SMC to quantify the global dependence of
the Be star fraction on metallicity. The incidence of Be/X-ray
binaries is also much higher in the SMC than in the LMC (Liu
et al. 2005), while the incidence of Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars
is much lower; therefore, a comparison of infrared excesses
for these objects is also of interest. Finally, there is interest in
the metallicity dependence of the mid-infrared colors of red
supergiants, which probe circumstellar dust.

Following the same strategy as in Paper I, we compiled a
catalog of massive stars, which we cross-matched in the SAGE-
SMC database to study their infrared properties. This paper
is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our spectroscopic
and photometric catalogs of massive stars in the SMC, Section 3
presents the resulting color–magnitude and two-color diagrams,
and Section 4 presents the infrared excesses detected in various
types of massive stars. Section 5 investigates the mass-loss rates
in red supergiants and Section 6 summarizes our results.

2. CATALOG OF MASSIVE STARS IN THE SMC

As in Paper I, we have compiled a catalog of massive stars
with known spectral types in the SMC from the literature.
We then cross-matched the stars in the SAGE-SMC database,
after incorporating optical and near-infrared photometry from
recent surveys of the SMC. The resulting photometric catalog
was used to study the infrared properties of the stars. In
Section 2.1, we describe the spectral-type catalog compiled from
the literature, in Section 2.2, the existing optical, near-infrared,
and mid-infrared surveys of the SMC, which were included in
the SAGE-SMC database, and in Section 2.3, the cross-matching
procedure and the resulting photometric catalog.

2.1. Spectral-type Catalog

The criteria for inclusion in the spectral-type catalog of mas-
sive SMC stars were the availability of accurate coordinates
and accurate (mainly optical) spectral classiﬁcations that cor-
respond to stars with masses (cid:2)8 M(cid:3). The 2dF Survey (2dFS;
Evans et al. 2004a, 4161 objects) comprises the largest catalog
of SMC stars with spectroscopic classiﬁcations and therefore
makes up the backbone of our spectral-type catalog.15 Previous
compilations (e.g., Azzopardi et al. 1975; Azzopardi & Vigneau
1979, 1982) were included with updated coordinates from Brian
Skiff’s lists16 and spectral types from the literature, when avail-
able. The literature search resulted in 5324 entries. We do not
claim completeness; however, we have targeted not only studies

14 The dependence of v∞ on Z is negligible for this range of Z (see Leitherer
et al. 1992; Evans et al. 2004b).
15 By retaining all SMC stars from 2dFS, we are possibly including some stars
with masses <8 M(cid:3).

of hot massive stars (deﬁned by their spectral types) in individ-
ual clusters and OB associations, but also studies of particular
types of massive stars. The largest of these include the survey of
B and Be stars in NGC 330 (Martayan et al. 2007a, 2007b, 314
stars), the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars in NGC 330
and NGC 346 (Evans et al. 2006, 232 stars), and unpublished
additional FLAMES observations in NGC 346 (PI: Evans; I.
Hunter et al. 2010, in preparation, 244 OB & A-type stars).
We have also added the three known luminous blue variables
(LBVs), ﬁve supergiant B[e] stars (Zickgraf 2006), 69 Be/X-ray
binaries (with spectral types from the updated online catalog17
of Raguzova & Popov 2005), early-type eclipsing and spectro-
scopic binaries, and red supergiants (Massey & Olsen 2003;
Levesque et al. 2006, 2007, 107 stars). The completeness of
the catalog depends on the spectral type, e.g., it is ∼4% for the
unevolved O stars in our catalog (out of an estimated total of
2800 unevolved stars with masses >20 M(cid:3) in the SMC; Massey
2010), while the W-R catalog (Massey et al. 2003) is thought to
be close to complete.

Table 1 presents our catalog of 5324 massive stars, sorted by
R.A., listing: the star name(s), coordinates in degrees (J2000.0),
the reference, and corresponding spectral classiﬁcation. The
names of the stars are taken from the corresponding reference.
The spectral classiﬁcations in the catalog are typically accurate
to one spectral type and one luminosity class. We retained about
a dozen stars from the above studies with only approximate
spectral types (e.g., “early B”). For double entries, we selected
the most precise spectral classiﬁcation available, usually corre-
sponding to the most recent reference.

2.2. Optical and Infrared Surveys of the SMC

Several large optical and infrared photometric catalogs of the
SMC have recently become available, enabling us to obtain
accurate photometry for its massive star population in the
wavelength range 0.3–8 μm and in some cases up to 24 μm.
The optical surveys are as follows: the UBVR catalog of Massey
(2002) with 85,000 bright stars in an area covering 7.2 deg2, the
UBVI Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (MCPS; Zaritsky
et al. 2002) including 5.1 million stars in the central 18 deg2 of
the SMC, and the OGLE III catalog containing V I photometry
of 6.2 million stars covering 14 deg2 (Udalski et al. 2008). The
angular resolution is ∼2.(cid:6)(cid:6)6 for the catalog of Massey (2002),
∼1.(cid:6)(cid:6)5 for MCPS, and ∼1.(cid:6)(cid:6)2 for OGLE III.

The existing near-infrared photometric catalogs include: the
Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006,
extended by 6X2MASS) and the targeted IRSF survey (Kato
et al. 2007), which contains 2.8 million sources in the central
11 deg2 of the SMC. 2MASS has a pixel scale of 2.(cid:6)(cid:6)0 pixel−1,
an average seeing of 2.(cid:6)(cid:6)5 and limiting magnitudes of J = 15.8,
H = 15.1, and Ks = 14.3. IRSF has a pixel scale of 0.(cid:6)(cid:6)45
pixel−1, average seeing of 1.(cid:6)(cid:6)3, 1.(cid:6)(cid:6)2, and 1.(cid:6)(cid:6)1 in the JHKs bands,
respectively, and limiting magnitudes of J = 18.8, H = 17.8,
and Ks = 16.6. In the mid-infrared, the Spitzer SAGE-SMC
survey uniformly imaged the whole SMC (∼30 deg2) in the
IRAC and MIPS bands on two epochs in 2007–2008 (K. D.
Gordon et al. 2010, in preparation). The survey has recently
produced a combined mosaic catalog of 1.2 million sources.
IRAC, with a pixel scale of 1.(cid:6)(cid:6)2 pixel−1, yields an angular
resolution of 1.(cid:6)(cid:6)7–2.(cid:6)(cid:6)0 and MIPS at 24 μm has a resolution
of 6(cid:6)(cid:6).

Given the variation in the depth, resolution, and spatial
coverage of these surveys, we included the available photometry
for the massive stars in our catalog from all
the MCPS,
OGLE III, 2MASS, IRSF, and SAGE-SMC catalogs. MCPS
has incorporated the catalog of Massey (2002) for bright stars
common to both catalogs. Photometry of higher accuracy,
particularly in the optical, exists in the literature for many of
the stars in our catalog; however, it was not included in favor of
uniformity.

2.3. Photometric Catalog

2.3.1. Matching Procedure

We used the following SAGE-SMC data products to search
for the mid-infrared counterparts to the 5324 massive stars listed
in Table 1: the v1.0 IRAC Catalog containing IRAC Epoch 1 data
bandmerged with All-Sky 2MASS and 6X2MASS catalogs, and
the MIPS 24 μm Epoch 1 Catalog. The details about the SAGE-
SMC data processing and Legacy data products can be found in
K. D. Gordon et al. (2010, in preparation) and in “The SAGE-
SMC Data Description: Delivery 1” document available at the
NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive Web site.18 The IRAC
catalog and MIPS 24 μm catalog contain high-reliability sources
and are subsets of more complete, but less reliable source lists:
the IRAC Archive and MIPS 24 μm full list (see the data delivery
document for a comparison between the catalogs and archives/
full lists).

We started constructing the photometric catalog for the mas-
sive stars in our list by selecting their SAGE-SMC IRAC Epoch
1 Catalog counterparts. We performed a conservative neighbor
search with a 1(cid:6)(cid:6) search radius and selected the closest match

for each source. We found mid-infrared counterparts for 3654
out of 5324 sources. The IRAC Epoch 1 catalog (IRACC),
MIPS 24 μm catalog, IRSF, MCPS, and OGLE III catalogs
were crossed-matched in the SAGE-SMC database19 to pro-
vide photometry for sources over a wavelength range from 0.3
to 24 μm. We used this “universal catalog” to extract multi-
wavelength photometry for IRAC sources matched to the mas-
sive stars. Speciﬁcally, for IRAC sources with one or more
matches in other catalogs (all but 5), we only considered the clos-
est matches between sources from any two available catalogs
(IRAC-MIPS24, IRAC-MCPS, MIPS24-MCPS, IRAC-IRSF,
MIPS24-IRSF, IRAC-OGLE III, MIPS24-OGLE III), with dis-
tances between the matched sources of (cid:3)1(cid:6)(cid:6). For example, for
a match between the IRAC, MIPS 24 μm, and MCPS catalogs
(IRAC-MIPS24-MCPS), we applied these constraints on the
IRAC-MIPS24, MIPS24-MCPS, and IRAC-MCPS matches. If
the match was not the closest one or the distance was >1(cid:6)(cid:6),
we dropped the pair. These stringent criteria were used to en-
sure that sources from individual catalogs for each multi-catalog
match refer to the same star. Table 2 shows the breakdown of
the matched stars to the catalogs, such that 40 stars were only
matched to the IRACC, 214 only to the IRACC+IRSF catalogs,
etc.

2.3.2. Catalog Description

Table 3 presents our ﬁnal matched catalog of 3654 stars, with
the star name, IRAC designation, UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24
photometry and errors, reference paper, corresponding spectral
classiﬁcation and comments, sorted by increasing R.A. Overall,
the photometry is presented in order of shortest to longest
wavelength. The 17 columns of photometry are presented in the
following order: UBVI from MCPS, V I from OGLE III, JHKs
from 2MASS, JHKs from IRSF, IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 μm
(or [3.6], [4.5], [5.8], [8.0]), and MIPS 24 μm (or [24]). A
column with the associated error follows each measurement,
except for the V I photometry from OGLE III. Henceforth,
JHKs magnitudes refer to 2MASS photometry, whereas IRSF
photometry is denoted by a subscript, e.g., JIRSF. All magnitudes
are calibrated relative to Vega (e.g., see Reach et al. 2005, for
IRAC). In Table 4, we summarize the characteristics of each
ﬁlter: the effective wavelength λeff, zero magnitude ﬂux (in Jy),
angular resolution, and the number of detected stars in each
ﬁlter.

The spatial distribution of our 3654 matched sources is shown
in Figure 1, overlaid onto the 8 μm image of the SMC. For
clarity, only a third of the early- and late-B stars are shown; these
are equally distributed along the SMC bar and wing. Other types
are concentrated along the bar, partly due to the fact that most
spectroscopic surveys have targeted the bar. The 8 μm emission,
which maps the surface density of the interstellar medium, is
stronger in the SMC bar than the wing, since the former contains
more star-forming regions.

3. INFRARED COLOR–MAGNITUDE AND TWO-COLOR
DIAGRAMS

We divide the matched stars into 10 categories accord-
types: O stars, early (B0−B2.5) and
ing to their spectral
late (B3−B9) B stars (the majority of these have super-
giant or giant luminosity classiﬁcations), spectral-type A-, F-,
and G-type (AFG) supergiants, K and M red supergiants
(RSGs), W-R stars, supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars, conﬁrmed
LBVs, Be/X-ray binaries and stars with composite features

of both A and F stars (AFcomp; Evans et al. 2004a, see also
Section 4.4). Note that 813 stars not included in any of the
above categories are classiﬁed as “other” (and only shown in
certain plots).20 Most are A stars with luminosity class II or
F/G stars without a luminosity classiﬁcation from Evans et al.
(2004a), although with vradial > 100 km s−1. To allow for a
direct comparison with the LMC results of Paper I, we present
the same color–magnitude and two-color diagrams (CMDs and
TCDs), identifying stars in the 10 categories described above.21
Infrared [3.6] versus [3.6] − [4.5] and J − [3.6] CMDs
for all
the stars in the catalog are shown in Figures 2
and 3. The locations of all the SAGE-SMC catalog detections
are represented by the gray two-dimensional histogram (Hess
diagram). The red giants form the clump at [3.6] > 15 mag,
while the vertical blue extension contains late-type SMC and
foreground stars (free–free emission causes the OB stars to have
redder colors). The asymptotic giant branch stars are located at
[3.6] ∼ 11 mag and J − [3.6] ∼ 2 mag. The RSGs, sgB[e],
and LBVs are among the brightest stars at 3.6 μm and occupy
distinct regions in the diagrams (as in the LMC). Most of the O
and B stars are located along a vertical line at [3.6] − [4.5] ∼ 0,
as expected. The RSGs have “blue” colors because of the de-
pression at [4.5] due to the CO band (see, e.g., Verhoelst et al.
2009). The sgB[e] stars are 0.6–0.8 mag redder and can have
similar brightnesses to the RSGs. The late-B stars are brighter
than the early-B stars because most of the former are lumi-
nous supergiants. A reddening vector for E(B − V ) = 0.2 mag
(corresponding to some of the largest values for color excess
found by Massey et al. 1995; Larsen et al. 2000) is shown in
Figure 3 to illustrate the small effect of reddening, which de-
creases at longer wavelengths. We note that the reddest of
the bright AFG supergiants is the F0I eclipsing binary R47
(Prieto et al. 2008). In Figure 3, we ﬁnd three early-B-type stars
with colors similar to the sgB[e] stars, although they are fainter
at [3.6]. In order of increasing J − [3.6] color, these stars are
2dFS0402, 2dFS2411, and 2dFS2673 (all classiﬁed as B0-5V).
Their evolutionary status is not clear though they are worthy of

denote different spectral types. For clarity, only a third of the early- and late-B stars are shown; these are equally distributed along the SMC bar and wing. Other types

luminous, while the RSGs are less dusty (see Section 5).

[8.0] − [24] ∼ 0, while dusty stars (including RSGs, LBVs,
sgB[e] stars) are reddened. The faint population of sources with
[8.0] − [24] ∼ 3.5 mag corresponds to background galaxies.
We detect dusty LBVs, sgB[e], RSGs, yellow supergiants, and
some dusty early-B stars in these CMDs. The detection of the
following stars—labeled as “other”—at [24] (in order of in-
creasing magnitude at [24]): 2dFS352822 (F0), 2dFS0712 (G8),
and 2dFS1829 (G2), provides further evidence for their super-
giant luminosity class and thus membership to the SMC. The
early-B-type stars appearing in these diagrams, in order of in-
creasing magnitude at [24] are as follows: 2dFS0402, 2dFS2673
(both of type B0-5V; discussed above), AzV 9 (B0III), AzV 201
(B1(Be-Fe)), AzV 409 (or 2dFS2201; B0.5Ib), AzV 230 (B0Ib),
and AzV 390 (B2Iab:). Of these, both AzV 409 and AzV 230
have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with disk-like char-
acteristics in all Spitzer passbands (i.e., similar to the Be star
SEDs shown in Paper I, Figure 17), although the former has a
slight upturn at [24]. The nature of these objects is discussed in
Section 4.5. Finally, the late-B and AFG supergiants present in
these diagrams are hypergiants whose spectra and SEDs indi-
cate the presence of substantial stellar winds. A comparison of
the colors of various types of massive stars in the LMC versus
SMC CMDs reveals that the colors of the RSGs differ the most
(see Section 4.5.3).

In Figures 6–8, we present TCDs using the near- and mid-
infrared photometry from our matched catalog. We label stars
according to their spectral types and overplot all the SAGE-
SMC detections in gray as Hess diagrams. Stars without dust
have mid-infrared colors near 0. Late-type stars can have J −Ks
excesses of (cid:3)2 mag, while the group of stars with colors
Ks − [8.0] ∼ 3, [4.5] − [8.0] ∼ 2, and [8.0] − [24] ∼ 3.5 mag
correspond to young stellar objects and background galaxies.
We have overplotted six simple theoretical models to guide the

interpretation of the stars in these diagrams, which are described
in detail in Paper I: (1) a blackbody (BB) at various temperatures,
(2) a power-law model Fν ∝ να, for −1.5 (cid:3) α (cid:3) 2, (3) an OB
star (represented by a 30,000 K BB) plus an ionized wind, (4)
an OB star plus emission from an optically thin H ii region,
(5) an OB star plus 140 K dust, (6) a 3500 K BB plus 250 K
dust. The most conspicuous stars in all TCDs are the sgB[e]
stars, which have large excesses of ∼4 mag in the K − [8.0]
color, similar to the sgB[e] stars in the LMC. R4, a B0[e]-type
LBV, has mid-infrared colors intermediate between sgB[e] and
Be stars. We ﬁnd a remarkable bimodal distribution of the OB
stars, most clearly seen in Figure 6, with the redder grouping
corresponding to Oe and Be stars (see Section 4.1 for more
details). Among these outliers are the Be/X-ray binaries and
other emission line stars, including some yellow supergiants.
The near-infrared excesses found among the sgB[e] and W-R
stars are on average lower than in the LMC, presumably due to
the lower metallicity of the SMC. Finally, the RSGs, in contrast
to their distribution in the LMC TCDs, are found to be clustered,
due to the lower dust production rates at the metallicity of the
SMC (see Section 5).

4. INFRARED EXCESSES OF MASSIVE STARS IN THE
SMC VERSUS THE LMC

In this section, we study the infrared excesses of speciﬁc
spectral types of massive stars, comparing them with the infrared
excesses found in Paper I for the same types of stars in the LMC.

JIRSF − [5.8], and JIRSF − [8.0] colors for the 208 O and
1967 early-B stars in our catalog, respectively, denoting their
luminosity classes, binarity, and emission line classiﬁcation
properties by different symbols. We compare the observed

binaries with a large circle, and Oe stars with an ×. The solid lines correspond
to 30 kK and 50 kK TLUSTY models with log g = 4.0. A reddening vector
for E(B − V ) = 0.2 mag is shown, as well as reddened TLUSTY models by

metallicity and effective temperatures. For reference, reddening
vectors and TLUSTY models reddened by E(B −V ) = 0.2 mag
infrared excesses from
are also shown. We clearly detect
free–free emission despite not having dereddened the stars, as in
the LMC. At longer wavelengths, the excess is larger because the
ﬂux due to free–free emission for optically thin winds remains
essentially constant with wavelength. Fewer stars are detected
at longer wavelengths because of the decreasing sensitivity of
Spitzer and the overall decline of their SEDs. We ﬁnd that
the majority of early-B supergiants in the SMC exhibit lower
infrared excesses, when compared to their counterparts in the
LMC (see Paper I), due to their lower mass-loss rates, although
certain exceptions exist and deserve further study.

The CMDs allow us to study the frequency of Oe and Be
stars, given the low foreground and internal reddening for the
SMC. Our SMC catalog contains four Oe stars among 208
O stars (see Figure 9), of which one is bluer than the rest.
There are 16 additional stars with JIRSF − [3.6] > 0.5 mag
and JIRSF < 15 mag (including all luminosity classes), whose
spectra appear normal (although the Hα spectral region in most
cases was not observed). We refer to these as “photometric
Oe” stars and attribute their infrared excesses to free–free
emission from a short-lived, possibly recurrent circumstellar
region, whose Hα emission line was not detected during the
spectroscopic observations either because the gas had dispersed
or because the region was optically thick to Hα radiation or
the observation spectral range just did not extend to Hα. Given
˙M at SMC metallicity, we argue that
the expectation of lower

excesses. Including these “photometric Be” stars and using the
same color and magnitude cuts as for the “photometric Oe”
stars above, yields fractions of Be stars among early-B stars
of 27% ± 2% for the SMC and 16% ± 2% for the LMC (cf.
32% from young SMC clusters; Wisniewski & Bjorkman 2006).
Table 5 summarizes these results. We compare our results with
the fractions determined by Maeder et al. (1999) from young
clusters, i.e., 39% for the SMC and 23% for the LMC, ﬁnding
ours to be lower, although the sample selections were very
different.

These preliminary statistics (available for the ﬁrst time for
Oe stars) indicate that both Oe and Be stars are twice as
common in the SMC than in the LMC. We emphasize the
importance of including the “photometric Be” stars, which
signiﬁcantly increase the frequencies of Oe/O and Be/early-
B stars determined and are crucial when comparing such stars
in different galaxies. This novel method of conﬁrming Oe and
Be star candidates from their infrared colors or a combination
of their optical and infrared colors, as recently suggested by Ita
et al. (2010a) is complementary to the detailed spectroscopic
analyses by e.g., Negueruela et al. (2004) on individual Oe stars
to understand their nature, although it is limited to galaxies with
low internal reddening. We ﬁnally note that the spectral types of
Oe stars in the SMC (O7.5Ve, O7Ve, O4-7Ve, and O9-B0III-Ve)
and the LMC (O9Ve (Fe ii), O7:Ve, O8-9IIIne, O3e) are earlier
than those of known Galactic Oe stars, which are all found in
the O9-B0 range (Negueruela et al. 2004).

To illustrate the double sequence more clearly, we present the
same information in a histogram in Figure 11 for the early-B
stars in both the LMC (from Paper I) and SMC, divided into
magnitude bins. For stars with JIRSF − [3.6] ∼ 0, we ﬁnd the
brighter, more luminous stars to be redder (cf. top three panels of
Figure 11), as in Paper I. In the second and third panels, the mean
values of the JIRSF − [3.6] colors for the (blue, red) peaks are:
(−0.07, 0.74) and (−0.09, 0.71) mag for the SMC and (−0.01,
0.66) and (−0.06, 0.79) mag for the LMC. The blue peak for the
SMC stars is thus bluer than for the LMC, which is primarily
due to the higher foreground reddening toward the LMC. In the
second panel, we ﬁnd the separation between peaks to be larger
for the SMC (0.81 mag) than the LMC (0.67 mag), implying
that the SMC Be stars have larger infrared excesses than their
LMC counterparts. Unfortunately, in the third panel, the red
peak of the LMC stars is barely discernible, therefore we cannot
conﬁrm this difference. We also ran a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
to check whether the stars are drawn from the same population
(assuming the sample is unbiased). This yielded a probability
of 5.0 × 10−3 (for the stars in the second row) and 5.7 × 10−5
(third row), implying that the underlying populations are indeed
different.

Finally, we note that the brightest Be stars in the SMC
(JIRSF ∼ 13.2 mag) are brighter than the brightest Be stars in the
LMC (JIRSF ∼ 13.4 mag), i.e., there is a 0.7 mag difference in
absolute magnitude, given the 0.5 mag difference in the distance
moduli. Garmany & Humphreys (1985) were the ﬁrst to make

Figure 10. Same as Figure 9, but for 1967 early-B stars. The solid lines
correspond to 20 kK, log g = 3.0 and 30 kK, log g = 4.0 TLUSTY models. A
reddening vector for E(B − V ) = 0.2 mag is shown, as well as reddened
TLUSTY models by this same amount (dotted lines). The distinct redder
sequence, corresponding to the Be stars, implies the possibility of identifying
or conﬁrming Be stars photometrically.
(A color version of this ﬁgure is available in the online journal.)

such a region is more likely to be a transient disk rather than
a wind. Assuming these are all Oe stars, we ﬁnd a 10% ± 2%
fraction of Oe stars among the O stars in the SMC. The error
in the fraction is dominated by small number statistics. In
contrast, there are four Oe and 14 “photometric Oe” stars (with
JIRSF − [3.6] > 0.5 mag and JIRSF < 14.5 mag) out of 354 O
˙M at LMC metallicity),
stars in the LMC (despite the higher
which yields a 5% ± 1% fraction of Oe stars among O stars in
the LMC.

Turning to the early-B stars, the most striking feature in
Figure 10 is a distinct sequence displaced by ∼0.8 mag to
the red. A large fraction of the stars falling on this redder
sequence have Be star classiﬁcations, although not all Be stars
reside there. Given that the circumstellar gas disks responsible
for the emission in Be stars are known to completely vanish
and reappear between spectra taken even one year apart (see
review by Porter & Rivinius 2003, and references therein), the
double sequence reported here provides further evidence for the
transient nature of the Be phenomenon. A bimodal distribution at
the L band was previously suggested by the study of Dougherty
et al. (1994), which included a sample of 144 Galactic Be
stars. Our larger Be sample, which is essentially unaffected by
reddening, and the inclusion of all early-B stars, clearly conﬁrms
the bimodal distribution. It is due to the much larger number of
Be stars classiﬁed in the SMC, in comparison to the LMC, as
well as the higher fraction of Be stars among early-B stars in the
SMC, which is 19% ± 1% versus 4% ± 1% in the LMC when
considering only the spectroscopically conﬁrmed Be stars (cf.
∼17% for <10 Myr B0–5 stars; Wisniewski & Bjorkman 2006).
Excluding the targeted sample of Martayan et al. (2007a, 2007b)
does not signiﬁcantly bias the statistics, since the fraction only
decreases to 15 ± 1%. We caution that incompleteness in our
catalogs could also affect the determined fractions, if our sample
turns out not to be representative of the whole population of OB
stars.

We proceed to deﬁne “photometric Be” stars as early-B-type
stars with an intrinsic color JIRSF − [3.6] > 0.5 mag, given that
a circumstellar disk or envelope is required to explain such large

AzV 229 WN6h; LBV binary) is labeled as an LBV in all
diagrams and is the only W-R star with a detection at [24].
We compare the colors of the W-R stars to those of their LMC
counterparts (see Paper I) and ﬁnd that their infrared excesses
are much lower, possibly indicating that their winds are much
weaker than those of LMC W-R stars. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd the
SMC W-R stars to have “bluer” colors: −0.2 < J − [3.6] < 0.5
(versus 0.2–1.7 for the LMC sample), −0.2 < J − Ks < 0.1
(versus 0–0.6), 0.4 < Ks − [8.0] < 1.2 mag (versus 0.4–1.8).
The origin of the hydrogen absorption lines seen in 10 of the
12 W-R stars (classiﬁed as “WN+abs” or “WNha”) remains
unclear, since radial velocity surveys have only conﬁrmed four
as binary systems (Foellmi et al. 2003). The absorption in the
other stars could alternatively be explained as photospheric
absorption (due to weak winds; Massey et al. 2003). The infrared
photometry made available for the W-R stars in this paper, will
enable modeling of their SEDs to determine the properties of
their stellar winds and perhaps the origin of the absorption lines.

4.4. AF Composite Stars

Evans et al. (2004a) discovered a class of objects with pecu-
liar composite spectra (AF composites or AFcomp), which yield
an A-type classiﬁcation from their Ca ii K lines, but an F-type
classiﬁcation from other metal lines and the G band. For exam-
ple, the classiﬁcation AFA3kF8 denotes such an AF composite
star, with Ca ii K like A3 and G band like F8. Our photometric
catalog contains 16 out of the 20 AF composite stars from the
2dF Survey of Evans et al. (2004a). The AF composite stars
that additionally exhibit forbidden emission lines (2dFS1804;
AFA3kF0/B[e] and 2dFS2837; AFA5kF0/B[e]) are labeled and
henceforth treated as sgB[e] stars.

The infrared colors of the AF composite stars provide further
clues to their nature and conﬁrm their astrophysical peculiarity.
In Figure 2, their [3.6] − [4.5] colors are indistinguishable from
AFG supergiants,24 while in Figure 3 they clearly have red
colors, with 0.5 < J −[3.6] < 1 mag. None are detected at [24].
In Figure 6, all four AF composite stars with [8.0] detections
show near-infrared colors in the range 0.3 < J − Ks < 0.9
mag; thus, intermediate between blue and red supergiants,
possibly indicating these stars are on blue loops or in interacting
binaries. The SEDs indeed are quite “ﬂat;” thus, not consistent
with normal single stars, while the multiple V I and JHKs
measurements reveal variability for several sources, which in
some cases can be conﬁrmed by light curves available from the
OGLE database (Udalski et al. 1997; Szyma´nski 2005). We note
that 2dFS2945 (HV 11519) is a known δ Cep pulsator.

4.5. Dusty Stars

Our catalog includes 166 stars with detections at [24], which
indicate the presence of dust. Of these, 97 are RSGs, ﬁve
sgB[e], and three LBV stars, all exhibiting dust, as expected.
Luminous supergiants with strong winds or disk-like SEDs
also exhibit infrared excess at [24] and [8.0] and therefore
appear in Figures 4 and 5. There are four B0-5 V type stars:
2dFS0402, 2dFS2411, 2dFS2673, and 2dFS3701 that have very
ﬂat SEDs. Additionally, we ﬁnd a class of 44 dusty OB stars
(16 late-O and 28 early-B stars, making up 2% of our sample),
with similar characteristics to the peculiar population of dusty
OB stars reported by Bolatto et al. (2007, 190 O9-B3 stars,
corresponding to 5% of their sample) in their S3MC survey and

SMC (left) and 586 in the LMC (from Paper I, right), divided into magnitude
ranges. The main peaks of the histograms shift to redder colors for brighter
stars. The redder secondary peaks correspond to the Be stars, which are more
numerous in the SMC.

such a comparison, ﬁnding the Be stars in the Magellanic Clouds
to be up to 1 mag brighter when compared to Galactic Be
stars, although their observation could be due to a selection
effect, related to the selection of ﬁeld versus cluster Be stars.
Even though our sample is not dominated by such selection
effects, we also ﬁnd the brightest Be stars in the SMC to be
intrinsically more luminous than their LMC counterparts. Given
that winds are weaker at low metallicity, it is possible that there is
a mechanism that allows disks to form at higher luminosities.23
Such a possibility would have interesting implications when
extrapolating to even lower metallicities (see, e.g., Ekstr¨om et al.
2008).

4.2. Be/X-ray Binaries

Dray (2006) found that both metallicity and a star formation
burst must be invoked to explain the large number of high-mass
X-ray binaries in the SMC, and consequently the large number
of Be/X-ray binaries. Of the 69 Be/X-ray binaries in our SMC
photometric catalog, 21 (or 30% ± 8%) were matched in the
SAGE-SMC database (versus four matches out of 20 Be/X-ray
binaries or 20% ± 11% in the LMC). Interestingly, some SMC
Be/X-ray binaries are brighter than their LMC counterparts,
despite being farther away, in agreement with the ﬁnding that Be
stars in the SMC occur at higher luminosity. A comparison with
the infrared colors of the Be/X-ray binaries in the LMC does not
reveal any differences. The SEDs of the SMC Be/X-ray binaries
show excess due to the disks around the Be stars, as in the
LMC. Finally, the multiple V I and JHKs measurements reveal
variability for many systems, which deserves further study.

4.3. Wolf–Rayet Stars

Of the 12 W-R stars in our spectral-type catalog, 10 were
matched in the SAGE-SMC database. HD 5980 (SMC-WR5;

23 This would also explain the larger infrared excesses found in Be stars in the
SMC, described in the previous paragraph.

24 The brightest AF composite star at [3.6] is 2dFS5049.

Hereafter, we refer to these stars as “dusty OB stars.” They are
characterized by a photospheric SED out to [5.8] and strong
[24] excess, which cannot be attributed to free–free emission.

a few giants and supergiants. In Figure 12, we plot SEDs for the

2dFS1192) and two examples of luminous supergiants with
infrared excess due to strong winds or disks (AzV 230, AzV 409;
2dFS2201). For completeness, in Figure 13, we show two
examples of late-B supergiants with [24] detections and the
ﬁve AFG supergiants that have [24] detections. Note, the F0
supergiants R47 (a rare eclipsing binary; Prieto et al. 2008)
and 2dFS3528 (an LBV candidate, see Section 4.5.2) are of
particular interest.

The dust detected in the class of “dusty OB stars” could either
be directly related to the OB stars or simply be contamination
given the volume of the SMC sampled with the 6(cid:6)(cid:6) resolution of
MIPS. While inspection of their environments shows that they
are located in or near young associations, they are frequently not

the youngest objects (earliest types), e.g., NGC 330 has three
“dusty OB stars” nearby and a turn-off of around B2 (Lennon
et al. 1993). We examined the spectra for 18 of these sources (12
from the 2dF Survey and six from the VLT-FLAMES Survey;
Evans et al. 2006), which all exhibit sharp nebular-like Balmer
emission lines; for those with red-optical spectra, seven also
have Hα nebular emission and three have weak [N ii] and [S ii]
lines, indicating the presence of a faint H ii region. Many sources
for which we do not have spectra available are either listed in Hα
emission line catalogs or lie in regions of faint nebulosity. Given
that most “dusty OB stars” are not found within very young
regions, we suggest that these sources represent unrelated cirrus
hot spots or cases where hot stars are ionizing nearby dusty
molecular clouds (rather than young stellar objects) producing
both the nebular emission lines and emission from warm dust
(as in Cepheus B, see e.g., Panagia & Thum 1981).

4.5.1. Supergiant B[e] Stars

In the SMC photometric catalog, we have detected seven
luminous sources with colors typical of sgB[e] stars (see Paper
I for an introduction), i.e., M3.6 < −8, [3.6] − [4.5] > 0.7,
and J − [3.6] > 2 mag (see Figures 2 and 3). Five of
these are previously known sgB[e] stars (with R50; B2-3[e]
being the brightest in all IRAC and MIPS bands), while R4
(AzV 16) is classiﬁed as an LBV with a sgB[e] spectral type. In

to differ, given their very different spectral types. Moreover, we
ﬁnd evidence for variability, which can be conﬁrmed from ex-
isting light curves in the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS;
Pojma´nski 2002), as pointed out by Szczygiel et al. (2010), who
studied the variability of the massive stars presented in Paper I in
the LMC. The various SED shapes and spectral types observed
depend on the time since the last outburst event and the amount
of dust formed.

Finally, we note that the F0 star, 2dFS3528 (Sk166) also lies
among the sgB[e] stars in Figures 4, 5, and 8 and near R4
(AzV 16; B0[e]LBV) in the other CMDs and TCDs, because it
has a similar SED (cf. Figures 13 and 14). Although Sanduleak
originally classiﬁed this star as “OB:,” its 2dF spectrum is clearly
F-type, but with strong Hα emission having broad wings, which
indicate a wind. Osmer (1973) designated it as a nonmember
based on its optical colors. It is included in the catalog of Massey
(2002)25 and indeed has some colors that are too blue, while
others are too red for its spectral type. However, the radial
velocity measured by Evans & Howarth (2008, +137±8 km s−1)
ﬁrmly places it in the SMC. The SED of 2dFS3528 is distinctly
sgB[e]-like and most similar to that of R4. All the above
characteristics, along with the variability detected in the near-
infrared, make this star an LBV candidate. Further monitoring
is highly desirable to conﬁrm its LBV nature.

4.5.3. Red Supergiants

The RSGs are among the brightest mid-infrared sources
in the SMC, with absolute magnitudes reaching −12 mag at
[3.6], and −13 mag at [8.0] and [24]. However, in the LMC,
some RSGs occur at higher [24] luminosities. SMC_018592
(K0-2I) is the brightest RSG at [3.6], [8.0], and [24] (see
Figures 2, 4, 5). In Figure 3, the following three RSGs have
“bluer” colors than the rest (in order of increasing [3.6]
magnitude): SMC_030135 (K2I), SMC_035231 (K2I), and
SMC_049990; 2dFS1517. The latter has two classiﬁcations:
K5I by Massey & Olsen (2003) and G2 by Evans et al. (2004a),
making it a variable candidate (also given its radial velocity:
+143 ± 5 km s−1; Evans & Howarth 2008). In Figure 6,
SMC_035231 (K2I) is the outlier at (0.4, 0.6), making it a
possible foreground dwarf; while SMC_058738 (K2I) is the
outlier at (1.0, 0.5). We note that SMC_055188 (M3-M4I) and
SMC_046662 (M0I) were reported by Levesque et al. (2007)
to have variable spectral types; they are included in our catalog
and are among the more reddened RSGs.

A comparison of the SMC CMDs and TCDs to the corre-
sponding ones of the LMC from Paper I reveals that the distri-
bution of RSG colors is quite different. The SMC RSGs have
a dominant population of non-dusty RSGs and a population of
dusty RSGs, with a distinct color distribution. In contrast, al-
most all RSGs in the LMC are dusty to some degree, with a
rather continuous distribution in color. This difference is due to
the lower dust content (∝Z), which is not compensated for by
the lower wind velocity (∝
Z, see van Loon 2000, 2006; van
Loon et al. 2008). Furthermore, since both the dust production
rate (cf. Sloan et al. 2008) and the dust-to-gas ratio depend on
Z (van Loon 2006), ˙M is independent of Z, though the wind ve-
locities of RSGs depend on metallicity (see, e.g., Habing et al.
1994; Marshall et al. 2004). While the optical and near-infrared
colors of RSGs have long been known to display a Z depen-
dence (cf. Arp 1959; Oestreicher et al. 1997), the systematics of

Figure 12. TLUSTY model atmospheres are overplotted for comparison:
15 kK, log g = 1.75 for the B8 and later types; 20 kK, log g = 2.25 for the
earlier types. The last two SEDs with composite spectral types closely resemble
the sgB[e] SEDs; note, these stars vary.

addition to these, we ﬁnd that 2dFS1804 (AFA3kF0/B[e]) has
a very similar SED (and therefore infrared colors) to the known
sgB[e] 2dFS2837 (AFA5kF0/B[e]). Evans et al. (2004a) also
remarked on the similarity of their spectra. We therefore conﬁrm
the supergiant nature of 2dFS1804 and present its SED in
Figure 14 along with those of other sgB[e] and LBV stars.
We note that both are photometrically variable. The similarity
of the SEDs of these sgB[e] stars, despite the various optical
spectral classiﬁcations, implies that all are the same class of
object. The cooler, composite spectral types indicate a lower
mass and perhaps a transitional stage to or from the sgB[e]
phenomenon. The only difference we ﬁnd between the sgB[e]
stars in the SMC versus the LMC is that on average they are
∼1–2 mag fainter (in absolute terms).

4.5.2. Luminous Blue Variables

All three known LBVs in the SMC: R4 (AzV 16, B0[e]LBV),
R40 (AzV 415, A2Ia: LBV), and HD 5980 (WN6h;LBV bi-
nary), were all detected at infrared wavelengths. In all CMDs
and TCDs, R4 is the more reddened LBV. It occupies a loca-
tion similar to other sgB[e] stars on the CMDs; however, in
Figures 6 and 7 it lies between the sgB[e] and the Be stars,
whereas the colors of HD 5980 (a well-known eccentric eclips-
ing binary, see e.g., Foellmi et al. 2008) are similar to those of the
LBVs in the LMC. We plot their SEDs in Figure 14 and ﬁnd them

samples (e.g., Groenewegen et al. 2009).

The true ˙M is obtained by applying scaling relations valid for

dust-driven winds (cf. van Loon 2007):

5. RED SUPERGIANT MASS-LOSS RATES

˙M = ˙Mreference(v/10)(0.005/ψ)(L/3000)0.5,

Our large samples of RSGs in the SMC and LMC lend
themselves to a study of the Z dependence of the mass-loss
rate. Figure 15 presents the MKs versus Ks − [24] CMD for
both SMC and LMC RSGs (from Paper I), on which the RSGs
are spread out as a result of various amounts of circumstellar
dust. The fainter RSGs in the SMC concentrate around a vertical
sequence at Ks − [24] ≈ 0.35 mag, but all other RSGs have
signiﬁcantly redder Ks − [24] colors indicative of the emission
from dust. A series of models for a star with spectral-type M0
and luminosity 85,000 L(cid:3) (Groenewegen 2006) are plotted for
reference, showing that the dust remains optically thin at near-
infrared wavelengths for Ks − [24] < 5 mag.

The Ks − [24] color is a good measure of the optical depth of
the circumstellar dust envelope. We use the results from radiative
transfer modeling presented in Groenewegen (2006) for a star of
luminosity L = 3000 L(cid:3), wind speed v = 10 km s−1, dust-to-
gas ratio ψ = 0.005, surrounded by silicate grains with a size of
0.1 μm and a condensation temperature of 1000 K. The relation
between this reference ˙M and Ks − [24] color is shown in
Figure 16, for a star of spectral-type M0 (typical for the SMC
stars) and again for a star of spectral-type M6 (at the cool
extreme of the LMC stars in our sample). For colors Ks −[24] <
0.8 mag, the relation is rather steep; given the inaccuracies in
photometry and stellar parameters we will not assign mass-loss
rates to these non-dusty stars. For colors 0.8 < Ks − [24] < 5
mag, the relation is quite well approximated by the formula:
log( ˙Mreference) = −8.6 + 0.5 × (Ks − [24]).
The deviations from this formula are not (much) more than a
factor of 2 for individual stars and will tend to average out when
considering the sample as a whole.

where the wind speed scales as (e.g., Marshall et al. 2004)

v = 10(ψ/0.005)0.5(L/3000)0.25.

For the dust-to-gas ratio ψ, we adopt a value roughly in
proportion to the metallicity of the stellar population, namely,
ψ ≈ 0.001 for the SMC and ψ ≈ 0.002 for the LMC (cf. van
Loon 2000, 2006). The luminosity is obtained by scaling the
Ks-band magnitude of the model star from Groenewegen (2006);
for the SMC stars we adopt Ks = 8.1 mag for the 3000 L(cid:3)
star, at a reference distance of 8.5 kpc (this corresponds to a
spectral-type M0) and Ks = 7.9 mag for the LMC stars (spectral
type about M2). The distance modulus to the SMC is taken as
18.91 mag and to the LMC as 18.41 mag (to be consistent with
Paper I). The inaccuracies in the luminosities resulting from this
approximation are of the order of 20%, which is small for our
purposes.

The estimated mass-loss rates show a clear positive correla-
tion with luminosity (see Figure 17), conﬁrming previous results
(van Loon et al. 1999, 2005; van Loon 2006; Groenewegen et al.
2009) with a larger sample of stars. Apparently, the fainter RSGs
are not very proﬁcient in their mass loss. However, these mass-
loss rates were derived by assuming that dust condenses in these
winds at the efﬁciencies expected from their metal content. This
may not be true, particularly in the relatively warm atmospheres
of early-M or late-K type stars, where the dust-to-gas ratio can
be much less than assumed here (cf. van Loon et al. 2005). In-
deed, at L < 9 × 104 L(cid:3) most of the RSGs in the SMC show
very little evidence of dust at all, but they may still exhibit a
purely gaseous wind. On the other hand, the values for the wind
speed are estimated to be 9–12 km s−1 for the SMC sample

428

the SMC, whereas the warmer prescriptions better reproduce the
luminous RSGs in the LMC. This is in conﬂict with the observed
differences in temperature, with the SMC RSGs having earlier
spectral types than their LMC counterparts.

The SMC sample on the whole exhibits lower dusty mass-
loss rates than the LMC sample (Figure 17), and RSGs in the
SMC appear to contribute relatively more at higher luminosities
(L > 9 × 104 L(cid:3)), while RSGs in the LMC also contribute
noticeably at fainter luminosities. Both observations are likely
related to the warmer atmospheres (earlier spectral types) of the
SMC RSGs compared to those in the LMC. We thus conjecture
that dusty mass loss plays a less important role in the SMC than
in the LMC, while other forms of mass loss may instead be
more important. For instance, as recently suggested (van Loon
et al. 2010a), the warmer winds of metal-poor RSGs could
be more susceptible to the coupling of Alfv´en waves, which
could provide a driving mechanism in the absence of radiation
pressure.

We emphasize that our samples miss the dustiest RSGs, which
are in brief episodes of very high mass loss; therefore, our results
only apply to the optically bright RSG phase. A few such very
dusty RSGs (known to exist in the Magellanic Clouds, e.g.,
Wood et al. 1992; Groenewegen & Blommaert 1998; van Loon
et al. 1999, 2010a, 2010b; Srinivasan et al. 2009) contribute
more dust than the entire samples of optically bright RSGs
considered here.

6. SUMMARY

This paper presents the ﬁrst catalogs of accurate spectral
types and multi-wavelength photometry of massive stars in the
SMC, which are used to study their infrared properties. The
spectroscopic catalog contains 5324 massive stars, with accurate
positions and spectral types compiled from the literature, and
constitutes the largest such catalog currently available for any
galaxy. The photometric catalog comprises uniform 0.3–24 μm
photometry in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24 bands for a
subset of 3654 stars that were matched in the SAGE-SMC
database. The low foreground reddening toward the SMC,
and the identical distance of the stars minimize systematic
errors due to reddening and enable the investigation of infrared
excesses. As in Paper I, we construct CMDs and TCDs,
and discuss the position of O, early- and late-B stars, W-R,
LBV, sgB[e], classical Be stars, RSGs, AFG supergiants, and
Be/X-ray binaries on them. These diagrams are useful for
interpreting infrared photometry of resolved massive stars in
nearby galaxies at low metallicity.

A comparison of the infrared colors of the massive stars in
the SMC to those of their counterparts in the LMC (presented in
Paper I) reveals differences that are due to the different evolution
at SMC metallicity. The main results of our study concern the
emission line Oe and Be stars, and the RSGs. We detected a clear
bimodal distribution of early-B stars, with the redder sequence
corresponding to classical Be stars and therefore propose that
Be stars (and similarly Oe stars) can be easily discriminated
photometrically, by their infrared colors. We ﬁnd the fraction of
emission line stars in the SMC (10% ± 2% for Oe and 27% ±
2% for Be) to be double that of the LMC (5% ± 1% for Oe
and 16% ± 2% for Be), when including the “photometric” Oe
and Be stars. This is the ﬁrst time the frequency of Oe stars
is determined beyond the Galaxy and at subsolar metallicities.
We also ﬁnd Be stars and Be/X-ray binaries to occur at higher
luminosity, sgB[e] stars to be on average less luminous than
their counterparts in the LMC (at [3.6]), and W-R stars to have

˙M vs. luminosity L for our samples of RSGs in the SMC (ﬁlled

circles; this work) and LMC (open circles; Paper I). No mass-loss rates could
be determined for stars with Ks − [24] < 0.8 mag; these are shown in the
bottom panel at their respective luminosities (crosses). Shown for reference are
the nuclear burning rates for the triple-α process at work in helium burning in
the cores of RSGs (dashed line), as well as the CNO cycle in hydrogen shell
burning (dotted line) and the prescription of de Jager et al. (1988) for 3000,
4000, and 5000 K (solid lines, labeled by the ﬁrst digit of the temperature).

(12–19 km s−1 for the LMC sample). This is consistent with
expectations for a ﬂuid in which the grains are well coupled
to the gas and thus can transfer momentum from the radiation
ﬁeld onto the bulk matter (cf. Marshall et al. 2004); much lower
values could bring this assumption into question (cf. McDonald
et al. 2009).

The mass-loss rate is next compared to the rate at which
matter is converted into energy in the central engine of the
star, to assess whether much mass is lost before the star is taken
elsewhere on its evolutionary path. In the context of core-helium
burning RSGs, the most relevant process is the triple-α process,
which has an efﬁciency η ≈ 5.9 × 1017 erg g−1 (Kippenhahn
& Weigert 1990); we also compare to the CNO cycle, which
governs hydrogen shell burning and has η ≈ 6.1 × 1018 erg g−1.
The nuclear burning rate (in M(cid:3) yr−1) is then
˙Mnuclear = 6.087 × 107(L/η).

(4)

We ﬁnd that essentially all RSGs in our samples lose mass
through stellar winds at a signiﬁcantly lower rate than that at
which helium is burned in their cores (Figure 17), often by
an order of magnitude difference. This is in stark contrast to
samples of RSGs that were selected from among the brightest
mid-infrared sources; van Loon et al. (1999) showed that most
of those RSGs have mass-loss rates similar to the nuclear
burning rate, with a few extreme objects exceeding that rate by a
signiﬁcant amount. The optically selected RSGs in the SMC and
LMC are therefore found to be in a more stable phase of RSG
evolution, in contrast to the RSGs selected as bright mid-infrared
sources, which have a shorter lifetime. The prescriptions of de
Jager et al. (1988) for 3000, 4000, and 5000 K coincide with
the most luminous LMC RSGs, but are too high for the less
luminous RSGs (in both galaxies). The 3000 K prescription of
de Jager et al. (1988) better reproduces the luminous RSGs in

smaller excess, all due to the different evolution at the lower
metallicity of the SMC.

The infrared colors of the RSGs in the SMC are found in
most cases to be consistent with little dust, with only the most
luminous sources showing excess emission presumably from
circumstellar dust. This is in contrast to the generally dusty
RSGs in the LMC and agrees with the expectation that the dust
content in metal-poor RSGs is lower. We ﬁnd that the mass-loss
rates in SMC RSGs correlate positively with luminosity, as in the
LMC. Finally, we conﬁrm the astrophysical peculiarity of the
composite A & F type spectra discovered by Evans et al. (2004a),
the sgB[e] nature of 2dFS1804, and ﬁnd the F0 supergiant
2dFS3528 to be an LBV candidate. This paper thus demonstrates
the wealth of information contained in the SAGE-SMC survey
and enables studies of the infrared properties of massive stars as
a function of metallicity, in combination with the SAGE survey
of the LMC. Studies of particular classes of massive stars and
whole massive star populations in nearby galaxies, as outlined
in Paper I, are obvious directions for follow-up.
